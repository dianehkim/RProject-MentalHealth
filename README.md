Final Project from Introduction to R (December 2021)

Created using RStudio, this project takes two datasets regarding mental health and compares them using R.

The data source found on Kaggle, is originally from Open Sourcing Mental
Illness. Open Sourcing Mental Illness(OSMI) is a non-profit Indiana corporation
so it is based in the United States. The data set is about
a 2014 study on mental health disorders and people in the tech industryâ€™s
attitudes towards mental health in general.

The second data source is from data.world. Initially, the survey was done on
After School, a largely teen-focused social network site that surveyed high
school students about stress and mental health. This data set focuses on
students and their mental health in the workplace.

Used two datasets and analyzed the two to create meaningful data visualization
